1.Title of Project:Order Summary

2.Project Description:

At Newton School,I was required to code this Order Summary template as same as possible with the refernce provided.For this,I have used here CSS Flexbox and other CSS properties.Coding this section was fun as well as challenging,It was easy to code for desktop screen,but for the mobile it was little bit complicated to code.I took more time to code it for the mobile screen by using Media queries.

3.How to Use the Project

You can use this pre-made template in a shopping website or in any website where user needs to place order. You can use this directly without the need to code it.

4.Credits

I am very thankful to Newton School that they gave this project to perform which was very helpful for me.
